# Deno

<img align="right" src=src/assets/images/denoland.png height="150px">

Deno is a _simple_, _modern_ and _secure_ runtime for **JavaScript** and
**TypeScript** that uses V8 and is built in Rust.

### Features

- Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly
  enabled.
- Supports TypeScript out of the box.
- Ships only a single executable file.
- Built-in utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a code
  formatter (deno fmt).
- Set of reviewed standard modules that are guaranteed to work with
  [Deno](https://deno.land/std/).
